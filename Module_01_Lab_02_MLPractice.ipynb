        "\n",
        "Model Overfitting: When we have a very small training dataset, increasing the number of iterations can potentially lead to overfitting. The model might start fitting the noise in the training data rather than capturing the underlying patterns. Overfitting can result in high training accuracy but poor generalization to new, unseen data, including the validation set or, more importantly, the test data.\n",

        "Early Stopping: To mitigate overfitting, it's essential to monitor the validation performance during training and employ early stopping. Early stopping involves halting training when the validation performance starts to degrade. While this technique can help control overfitting, it means that even with more iterations,we may not fully exploit the potential of our model.\n",

        "Data Augmentation: If our dataset is very small, one way to make better use of it is through data augmentation techniques. Data augmentation involves applying transformations (e.g., rotations, translations, and flips for images) to create additional training examples from the existing ones. This can effectively increase the effective size of our training dataset without actually collecting more data.\n",

Careful consideration of techniques such as early stopping, data augmentation, and transfer learning is essential to make the most of limited data and improve model generalization. Additionally, it's crucial to set realistic expectations about the model's performance when working with small datasets."
